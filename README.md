# Piper Recording Studio

Local tool for recording yourself to train a [Piper text to speech](https://github.com/rhasspy/piper) voice.


## Installing

``` sh
git clone https://github.com/rhasspy/piper-recording-studio.git
cd piper-recording-studio/

python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Running

``` sh
python3 -m piper_recording_studio
```

Visit http://localhost:8000 to select a language and start recording.

Prompts are in the `prompts/` directory with the following format:

* Language directories are named `<language name>_<language code>`
* Each `.txt` in a language directory contains lines with:
    * `<id>\t<text>` or
    * `text` (id is automatically assigned based on line number)
    
Output audio is written to `output/`

See `--debug` for more options.


## Multi-User Mode

``` sh
python3 -m piper_recording_studio --multi-user
```

Now a "login code" will be required to record. A directory `output/user_<code>/<language>` must exist for each user and language.
